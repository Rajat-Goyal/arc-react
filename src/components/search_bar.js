    // Handling events in react involves two step process:

// STATE: state is a plain javascript object that is used to record and react to user events. Each class
// based component that we define has its own state object. Whenever a component state is changes
// the component immediately re-renders and also forces all of its children to re-render as well.
// Functional components dont have state, only class based have it.

// All JS classes have a special function called constructor, constructor function is the first
// and only function called automatically whenever a new instance of the class is created.

// Constructor is reserved for doing some setup inside our class, like initializing variables and initializing state and stuff like that,

State management
1. Every instance has its own state.
2. Key takeaway: Input changing tells the state hey you need to change as well.
3. In ideal world state should tell input what the current of it should be.

class SearchBar extends Component {

    // initialize state inside constructor method.
    constructor(props) {
        // calling parent (Component) constructor.
        super(props);

        // whenever we use state we initialize it by creating a new object and assigning it to
        // this.state. Remember this is the only place where you should use this.sate = some object. Everywhere else use setState method
        this.state = { term: ''};
    }

    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                // What magic is happening here? Whenever we update the input element, whenever we change the value of it, event handler runs.
                // Inside of event handler, we set the state with the new value of the input. Whenever we update our state, with this.setState, it causes
                // our component to automatically rerender and push all the updated info from the render method into the DOM. Because our render method
                // makes reference to the this.state.term, every time the component rerenders, we get the updated this.state.term in the DOM.
                <input onChange={(event) => this.setState({ term: event.target.value })}/>
                <br/>
                Value of the input: {this.state.term}
            </div>
        );
    }
}
// Demo after this.
*/

/*
Controlled Component: Its value is set by state, so its value changes only when state changes.
Key Takeway: when users types in something, they did not change the value of input instead they just triggered an event
which changes a state and on state change value of input gets changed.
